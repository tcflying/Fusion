FN-6587 quarantines the CE broad-pnpm-test timeout flakes without timeout appeasement. Keep these excludes mirrored in scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json and remove or delete the files when the 14-day ratchet resolves.

FNXC:CompoundEngineeringTests 2026-06-17-16:20:
FN-6593 deletes orchestrator-flow.test.ts and skill-wiring.test.ts under the ratchet because the broad-workflow-only 5000ms timeout could not be tied to a narrow non-appeasement root cause.
Keep the ledger entries and excludes removed together; git history remains the archive for this dropped CE orchestrator/skill-wiring coverage.

FNXC:CompoundEngineeringTests 2026-06-17-19:56:
FN-6606 re-ran the loaded CE node/package lane with sync.test.ts and work-bridge.test.ts temporarily unexcluded and could not reproduce either the 5000ms test timeout or the later 10000ms hook timeout.
The current HEAD's shared test-isolation fixes now keep the broad lane stable, so restore both files to active coverage and clear the stale quarantine in lockstep with scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json.

The SQLite-to-PostgreSQL cutover (feature quarantine-sqlite-internals-tests) quarantines CE plugin tests that fail with 'ctx.taskStore.isBackendMode is not a function' — pre-existing mock drift where the plugin session-store now calls ctx.taskStore.isBackendMode() but the orchestrator/session test mocks do not expose it. Confirmed failing on clean baseline (stash + rerun). Mirrored in scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json; rescue requires updating the CE test mocks to expose isBackendMode/getAsyncLayer.

          Dashboard tests run in jsdom and must not inherit the core Node-only isolation setup. That setup imports node:module/node:worker_threads and makes Vite externalize built-ins during browser-style setup, which regressed the CE test lane into slow startup followed by ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE.
