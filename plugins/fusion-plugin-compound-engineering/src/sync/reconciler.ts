/**
 * BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC RECONCILER (U8 / FN-5719 pattern).
 *
 * Two SEPARATE state machines are kept in sync, never merged (KTD4):
 *   - Board-task ownership  → the task's `column` (board is authoritative).
 *   - CE-pipeline ownership → `ce_pipeline_state.{currentStage,status}` (CE flow
 *                             is authoritative for artifact/pipeline content).
 *
 * INBOUND (board → pipeline): the lifecycle hooks (`onTaskMoved`/`onTaskCompleted`
 * in index.ts) do the MINIMUM under the 5s hook budget — resolve the link and
 * `enqueueSync(...)`, then return. They do NOT advance the pipeline inline.
 *
 * RECONCILE (the convergence guarantee): `reconcile()` is a single on-demand
 * sweep — NOT a tight interval poll (per docs/performance/dashboard-load.md).
 * It (1) drains the queue and (2) INDEPENDENTLY re-derives transitions by
 * comparing live board state (`ctx.taskStore`) against pipeline state. Step (2)
 * is why a DROPPED or never-enqueued hook event still converges: the queue is an
 * optimization; the board↔state comparison is the source of truth.
 *
 * OUTBOUND (pipeline → board): when a pipeline advances to a stage that produces
 * board work, the reconciler creates the next-stage board task via
 * `ctx.taskStore.createTask` and links it — propagating the CE-flow change onto
 * the board.
 *
 * TRIGGER MODEL (honest about the host seam): there is NO host scheduler wired to
 * call this on a timer. In production the sweep is invoked (a) right after the
 * hooks enqueue (a cheap drain on the same board mutation that triggered the
 * hook), and (b) on demand from a route (U9 settings/refresh surface) or on a
 * dashboard session-change. Because step (2) re-derives from board truth, any
 * single missed trigger is recovered on the NEXT sweep — no continuous poll loop
 * is needed for correctness.
