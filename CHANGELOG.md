# Fusion changelog

User-facing release notes aggregated across all packages. This file is auto-synced from each `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` by `scripts/release.mjs` — do not edit by hand.

## 0.74.0-beta.5

### Highlights

- Planning Mode and Settings keep every character you type, not just the first
- Cards no longer stall on "Queued to plan" with free slots after a planner hangs
- "Queued to plan" and "Ready" badges match what the engine will actually do with the card
- Expanded Mailbox reply-context rows stay open when you expand another row

### Fixed

- Planning Mode and Settings no longer drop typed text after the first character — the modal shell was remounting the focused input on every render.
- Cards stuck on "Queued to plan" while concurrency slots sat free are now re-offered for planning after a hung planner is evicted, instead of waiting for an engine restart.
- The "Queued to plan" and "Ready" badges on Todo cards now reflect whether the card is genuinely awaiting planning, rather than guessing from its step count. Todo rows carry this state through live board updates.
- Expanded reply-context rows in the Mailbox modal stay expanded when another row is opened; the recursive reply thread no longer remounts and collapses.

## 0.74.0-beta.4

### Highlights

- Code Review and Browser Verification now run with the card in In review, badged there
- Opt-in auto-update installs the new build and restarts Fusion on your release channel
- Cards no longer strand in Planning after Plan Review sends them back for changes
- Dashboard survives mobile tab discards, resyncs on reconnect, and stops caching API responses offline
- Agent tool output is capped at 16,000 characters, with a Settings control and a no-limit option

### New

- Code Review and Browser Verification run with the card sitting in In review, and the running step shows as a card badge. A changes-requested verdict still sends the card back to implementation.
- New global setting for auto-update and restart (off by default, in Settings → General next to Release channel). The post-update Restart button now always issues the request and shows the server's reason when it is refused, instead of sitting disabled.
- Core, workflow, and Git dialogs — 13 modal surfaces in all — are draggable and resizable on tablets, with geometry remembered between sessions.
- A Settings control for the agent tool-output limit, including 0 for no limit.
- The mobile project drop-down lists favorite projects in their own section at the top.
- You get a mailbox notice whenever a task is deleted by an agent tool or an unattributed API caller; deletions from the dashboard, CLI, and engine stay silent.

### Fixed

- Cards sent back for re-planning by Plan Review now actually get re-planned instead of sitting in Planning, and replan bounces keep the task worktree instead of tearing it down and re-cutting the branch.
- Cards can no longer sit waiting unowned on the planning path, a new watchdog reports any card idle past 30 minutes with no live session, and cards left with a stale "planning" status recover on a sweep instead of waiting for an engine restart.
- Self-healing no longer pauses cards whose planning session is still running, and queued planning admission walks past a declining lane instead of stalling the whole pass.
- Reviews stalled by an engine restart recover in one self-healing cycle rather than roughly 36 minutes, and the post-review fix budget default goes from 3 to 10.
- Review gates are harder to lose: symbol locks are reclaimed on the way back into work, hung gates are stall-detected, a just-started gate is no longer failed by a sweep, and a merge can no longer be enqueued before Code Review has run.
- Duplicate tasks are parked for your keep-or-delete decision instead of re-planning in a loop — including when the planner only reports the duplicate in its reply rather than writing the marker file.
- Deny now withholds task-creating tools from agent sessions, and the duplicate-create window widens from 60 seconds to 10 minutes so a retried create no longer duplicates.
- Approval reuse works on PostgreSQL instead of minting a duplicate request on every retry.
- A review task whose worktree was removed gets a fresh one instead of failing on every retry.
- Verification results stay concise, so a large failure dump no longer exhausts agent context.
- Incomplete foreach workflow steps are blocked from entering merge review.
- Planned hold-column cards whose Plan Review continuation was lost are recovered.
- Mobile board swipes from the first or last column advance one column instead of two.
- Task modals lose their excess tablet padding and dead right-edge space on landscape tablets while keeping usable touch resize grips; floating windows are touch-movable and resizable on tablets.
- Task-card cost badges return for legacy tasks with recorded token usage, and the size badge lines up when a card shows two status badges.
- Manual GitHub and GitLab import translations survive reopening the import panel.
- Cross-project plugin discovery no longer unloads enabled plugin skills.
- Task API endpoints return 404 for an unknown task id instead of a 500.
- Task logs no longer report engine-initiated aborts as operator hard-cancel pauses.
- Mailbox message links use theme colors instead of default browser blue.
- Routine diagnostic noise is reduced in the operator log view.
- Legacy desktop builds stay on one packageable Pi runtime dependency closure (Pi 0.82.0).
- A false handoff-invariant violation is no longer logged every time a task enters a review gate.

### Performance

- Every engine-injected tool result is bounded by a 16,000-character budget, so large reads preserve context capacity.

### Internal

- Task deletions record who asked — operator UI, CLI, agent tool, engine, or unattributed API. Attribution only; no delete gating was added.
- Review-gate leases record the node holding them, so a restarted engine can reclaim its own dead leases immediately instead of waiting out the staleness window.

## 0.74.0-beta.3

### Highlights

- Plans written in a task worktree now save back to the project and database
- Promote on a held card says why it was refused and can force past a pending replan
- Small mobile board swipes no longer jump several columns at once
- Mobile Settings footer buttons scroll sideways by touch when they overflow
- Cards no longer stay stuck with stale worktree metadata after an aborted plan

### New

- Promote on a held card now explains why the promotion was refused instead of showing a raw translation key, and offers a confirmed force option that pushes the card into execution past a pending replan. Force waives only the unplanned-for-execution gate — capacity, hold membership, and slot reservation still decide. Available from the board, the promote API, and the promote tool.

### Fixed

- Plans a planner writes inside a task worktree are now reconciled back to the main project before triage finalizes, and the authoritative plan is also stored as a task document, so plans no longer silently vanish.
- Cards are no longer left with stale worktree metadata when their branch inherited another task's commit. A branch cut from the base that never committed anything — planning aborted, card moved back to todo — was repeatedly rejected as foreign contamination on every self-healing sweep.
- Small horizontal swipes on the mobile board now advance one column instead of flinging several; extra pages require real gesture travel, not just release speed.
- The mobile Settings footer rail scrolls sideways by touch again when its buttons overflow the screen, including on landscape phones.

## 0.74.0-beta.2

### Highlights

- Two tasks can run Plan Review at the same time instead of one failing and parking
- Planning and every review step run in the task's own worktree, never the shared checkout
- Moving a card out of Todo mid-plan stops planning, clears the badge, and frees the worktree
- Session contention now waits and requeues on a 10-attempt ladder instead of parking the task
- Mobile Settings footer no longer clips the update notice and buttons

### Fixed

- Concurrent tasks no longer collide in Plan Review: the second task used to surface a provider failure and burn its retry budget. Sessions are now scoped per task even outside workspace mode.
- Planning and all review steps acquire the task's own worktree instead of degrading to the shared repo root; Plan Review re-acquires a worktree if its recorded one is gone.
- Remaining contention is treated as transient: the engine waits on a 10-attempt ladder from 5s to 60s and ends in a benign requeue rather than parking the task.
- Moving a card backward out of Todo while it is planning now aborts the in-flight planning run, clears the planning badge, and releases the pre-execution worktree.
- A new self-healing sweep reclaims parked pre-execution worktrees only after 30 days of complete inactivity, skipping todo, executing, paused, blocked, and recovery-scheduled tasks.
- On mobile, the Settings update-check result renders on its own row above the action buttons instead of being cut off; desktop and tablet keep it inline next to the version button.

## 0.74.0-beta.1

### Highlights

- Voice dictation in dashboard composers, opt-in with a checksum-pinned Parakeet v3 model
- Execution starts the moment planning finishes instead of waiting out the 15s engine poll
- Quick-add Start no longer strands tasks in Todo that could never be planned
- Open on duplicate-task warnings now actually opens the task
- Restart all agents in the System panel works again instead of erroring

### New

- Voice dictation across dashboard composers, gated behind a project-scoped Voice Input setting and disabled by default; the mic button stays inert until you turn it on.
- Voice Input settings panel for enabling dictation and managing the Parakeet v3 model, with live download and status controls.
- Parakeet v3 model downloads are verified against a pinned upstream SHA-256 checksum before use, and cached in a shared location across projects.
- Voice transcription API with project-bound audio endpoints and a lazily loaded speech runtime, so nothing extra is initialized unless dictation is on.
- Quiet CLI mode that suppresses informational stdout chatter, via the new quiet flag or the FUSION_QUIET environment variable.

### Fixed

- Starting a task now kicks off planning immediately from every surface (board drag, context menu, CLI, tools, API move) instead of waiting up to 15 seconds for the next planning poll. Todo cards still waiting on a planning slot show a "Queued to plan" badge, and the Start toast now honestly says "Queued for planning" rather than claiming planning began.
- Once planning finishes, the scheduler wakes and dispatches right away; plan-in-place workflows such as Coding (Ideas) previously sat idle until the next engine poll.
- Quick-add Start on a manual-intake workflow no longer creates tasks with placeholder steps that planning would skip forever, leaving them stuck in Todo with no log line.
- Coding (Ideas) boards can move cards back from Todo to Ideas again; the move check now respects the workflow's own column adjacency.
- The Open button on possible-duplicate task warnings works from every surface it appears on, and unresolvable task ids now show a toast instead of silently doing nothing.
- Restart all agents in the System panel no longer fails with a storage removal error.
- Planning Mode shows a single "Add comment to selection" button, and only after the selection is finished, so it no longer flickers mid-drag or duplicates on mobile.
- Creating a chat tag from the context menu applies it to the open conversation immediately.
- Reports Health Check now surfaces unrecoverable direct-report failures instead of hiding them behind stale state.
- Task composers no longer fire duplicate project-settings requests when the dictation button is present.

### Internal

- Hold-release sweeps log how long each card was held, a per-sweep summary with prefetch cost broken out, and a warning when a sweep exceeds 2 seconds.

## 0.74.0-beta.0

### Highlights
- Choose Anthropic API key vs. subscription per lane, with a clear "in use" indicator
- Fixed: AI helper lanes (subtasks, milestones, goals, reflections) no longer silently fall back to the wrong Anthropic model
- Fixed: Planning Mode no longer fails mid-interview with an auth error on a model you never picked
- Board scrolling is snappier — no more snap-lock on desktop, instant paging on phone swipes
- Tag and filter Direct chat conversations in the sidebar

### New
- Choose whether Anthropic lanes use your API key or your Claude subscription, with an "in use" marker in Settings → Authentication
- Board scrolling feels faster: desktop no longer snaps mid-drag, and phone swipes page immediately instead of coasting
- Task cards now show creation and completion dates directly
- Organize Direct chat conversations with reusable, project-scoped tags and sidebar filtering
- Quick Add now shows a visible Start button for workflows with a waiting column, instead of a hidden long-press menu

### Fixed
- Windows: direct-chat Agent selection now switches visibly and reliably
- New Task dialogs close without a discard confirmation when nothing was actually touched
- Tablets: Task Detail and New Task regain touch resizing
- AI helper lanes (interviews, subtask breakdown, agent generation, text refine, goal drafting, reflections) now run on your configured model instead of silently falling back to a default Anthropic model and erroring out for custom-provider or subscription users
- Large phones no longer lose the mobile bottom nav bar after being misclassified as tablets
- The footer now reads "Paused" instead of "Idle" when the engine is paused, and pausing from the terminal now takes two presses to avoid accidental toggles
- Planning Mode no longer fails mid-interview with a provider auth error tied to a model you never selected
- Switching projects now fully resets Planning, Chat, Missions, subtask breakdown, GitHub import, and any open modals so nothing leaks across projects
- Tablets: the Quick Chat header is easier to grab and drag
- Terminal windows no longer open blank until a keypress, font-size change, or new tab

### Internal
