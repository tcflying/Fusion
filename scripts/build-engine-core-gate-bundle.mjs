/**
 * FNXC:EngineTests 2026-07-08-04:10:
 * FN-7669 prototypes the #1 lever FN-7668 ranked: the `engine-core` merge
 * gate's dominant, precisely-quantified wall-time cost is vitest/Vite's
 * `import`-phase (SSR module-graph resolution + evaluation across the
 * ~430-file/215.8K-line production closure the 18 curated gate files reach
 * via the full `@fusion/core` barrel). Each of the 18 `pool:"forks"` OS
 * processes independently rebuilds this whole module graph from scratch with
 * NO cross-fork sharing. This script esbuild-bundles that closure — starting
 * from the FN-7667 gate-safe barrel copy (`packages/core/src/index.gate.ts`,
 * NOT the full `index.ts`, so this composes with FN-7667's narrowing rather
 * than working against it) — into a single first-party ESM file, collapsing
 * ~430 per-fork Vite SSR module-loader round-trips into one file load per
 * fork.
 *
 * Invalidation model: REBUILD-EVERY-RUN (the preferred, simplest, provably-
 * current design per the task spec). This script is invoked from the
 * `engine-core` vitest project's `globalSetup` before any of the 18 forks
 * spawn, so the bundle is (re)emitted fresh on every gate invocation — there
 * is NO drift surface, and no hand-maintained file/symbol list is ever
 * consulted (esbuild's own dependency graph, captured in a `metafile`,
 * enumerates every input file that fed the bundle; that metafile is written
 * next to the bundle for the coverage-parity / metafile-derived module-count
 * proof, see the task's `docs` document). Bundling a ~430-file first-party
 * closure with esbuild is typically sub-second — cheap enough that a
 * content-hash cache (this script's own alternative design) is unnecessary.
 *
 * Output is written under `packages/engine/node_modules/.gate-bundle/`,
 * which is gitignored: this is a rebuilt-every-run, non-committed artifact,
 * never a checked-in build output.

// Output lives at packages/core/.gate-bundle/ — a SIBLING of
// packages/core/node_modules/, deliberately NOT nested inside it. Two
// empirically-discovered constraints pin this exact placement:
//
// 1. Third-party bare-specifier resolution (e.g. bonjour-service, used by
//    node-discovery.ts and left `external` by esbuild's packages:"external"):
//    Node/Vite SSR resolves bare specifiers by walking UP the node_modules
//    chain from the importing file's own physical location. From
//    packages/core/.gate-bundle/core.mjs, that walk reaches
//    packages/core/node_modules on the very first step — same as it would
//    from any other file directly under packages/core/src/. A placement
//    under packages/engine/node_modules/ 404s on anything only core (not
//    engine) depends on (verified via a standalone `node --input-type=module
//    -e 'await import(...)'` check that threw ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for
//    'bonjour-service').
//
// 2. Vite SSR external-dep heuristic (the more serious constraint, found via
//    a real coverage-parity break): Vite's SSR module loader externalizes
//    (loads via Node's native import, OUTSIDE its own transform+mock
//    pipeline) any resolved module path containing a `node_modules` segment
//    by default. A first attempt that placed the bundle at
//    packages/core/node_modules/.gate-bundle/core.mjs was silently
//    externalized this way — vi.mock("node:child_process", ...) in the gate
//    test files stopped intercepting the `node:child_process` import nested
//    inside the bundled process-supervisor.ts (superviseSpawn), because Vite
//    handed that whole externalized bundle to Node's real loader instead of
//    its own mock-aware SSR graph. Symptom: 60/335 gate tests failed with
//    "spawned child without pid" / "Deterministic test verification failed"
//    (the REAL node:child_process ran instead of the test's mock). Moving
//    the bundle to a node_modules-free path keeps it inside Vite's normal
//    (non-externalized, mock-interceptable) SSR pipeline while still
//    resolving third-party deps correctly per point 1. See the task's docs
//    document "vi.mock risk check" section for the full repro.

 * Bundle the `@fusion/core` gate-safe barrel closure into a single ESM file.

 * Bundles ONLY the first-party closure reached transitively from the

 * third-party npm package is marked `external` via esbuild's `packages:
 * "external"` (bare-specifier imports resolve to `node_modules` and are left
 * as external `import` statements; only relative/absolute-path imports,
 * which is how the entire `@fusion/core` production closure is wired, get
 * inlined into the bundle). This means `node:sqlite` (used by
 * `sqlite-adapter.ts`, a Node 22+ built-in per FN-7668, not an npm native
 * addon) is correctly left as a runtime `import "node:sqlite"` rather than
 * mis-bundled.
 *
 * Returns the esbuild `metafile`, whose `inputs` map is the provably-
 * complete (esbuild-graph-derived, not hand-maintained) enumeration of every
 * first-party file that fed the bundle — this is both the invalidation
 * dependency set (were this the content-hash-cache design) and the ~430→1
 * module-load-count proof cited in the task's `docs` document.
