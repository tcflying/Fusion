FNXC:EmbeddedPresentation 2026-06-22-12:00:
Seven modal components (ActivityLogModal, GitManagerModal, GitHubImportModal, ScheduledTasksModal, PlanningModeModal, SettingsModal, WorkflowNodeEditor) each independently grew the same "embedded vs modal" presentation switch for the right-dock / main-content-area redesign. Each derived `isEmbedded = presentation === "embedded"` locally and gated the same modal-only behaviors off it: mobile scroll lock, modal resize-persist, Escape-to-close, and overlay click-dismiss.

This hook collapses that copy-pasted pattern into one place. The returned booleans are the enabled-arg for the hooks/handlers the components already call (e.g. `useMobileScrollLock(open && scrollLockEnabled)`), so the gating stays a single boolean expression and the underlying hooks remain CALLED UNCONDITIONALLY (React hook rules) — only their enabled arg flips.

Embedded surfaces are persistent main-content destinations owned by the dock/router, so all four modal-only affordances are disabled when embedded; every flag is simply `!isEmbedded`. Modal presentation (the default) keeps every affordance on, byte-identical to the historical behavior.

 * - `resizePersistEnabled` — gate for modal-only FloatingWindow geometry; off when embedded (the view fills its container).
 * - `escapeEnabled` — gate for Escape-to-close handlers; off when embedded (the dock/router owns lifecycle).
 * - `overlayDismissEnabled` — gate for backdrop click-to-dismiss; off when embedded (no overlay backdrop exists).
