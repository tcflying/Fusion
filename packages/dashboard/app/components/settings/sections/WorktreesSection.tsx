FNXC:SettingsStyling 2026-07-15-17:35:
The plain label+control+help rows here render through the shared settings primitives instead of hand-rolled `form-group` + `checkbox-label` markup, so their labels, help copy, and padding come from the one settings type scale. `.form-group` itself stays untouched and global — 35 non-settings files style forms with it, so settings migrate off it rather than restyle it underneath the rest of the dashboard.

FNXC:SettingsScope 2026-07-15-17:35:
Every migrated key in this section is project-scoped (`DEFAULT_PROJECT_SETTINGS`): worktree count, layout, naming, and rebase policy describe one repository's checkout strategy and must not follow the operator to another project. The badges restate that per row because settings search can land an operator on a single control with no section chrome in view.

FNXC:SettingsStyling 2026-07-15-17:35:
Four groups deliberately keep their bespoke markup because they are not plain label+control+help rows:
- The `worktreeCopyFiles` allowlist is a repeating row editor with per-row Browse/Remove buttons.
- `worktreesDir` pairs its input with a Browse button and swaps in rich `<code>`-bearing help.
- `executorAllowSiblingBranchRename` and `worktreeRebaseRemote` compose their help from several `t()` fragments interleaved with `<code>` elements; a descriptor `help` is a single string, and flattening that copy would reword operator-facing text.
- The whole worktrunk block edits one nested `worktrunk` object (not a top-level settings key), carries `<code>`-bearing help, cross-field disabled logic, and an install affordance.

FNXC:SettingsHelp 2026-07-15-21:40:
Those bespoke rows still hang their help off the same "?" as the migrated ones: each one's `<small>` moved into a `SettingsHelpTip` beside its label (`.settings-field-label-row`), so the section reads as one idiom instead of "rows with a help icon" next to "rows with a paragraph". The tip takes `ReactNode`, so the `<code>`-bearing copy above moves verbatim.
The worktrunk install affordance keeps its inline `<small>`s: install state, the installed path/version, and the "install the binary below to enable this" precondition are live status and operator next-steps, not a description of what a control does — deferring them behind a "?" would hide the reason a control is disabled.

      Recycling and Task-ID naming are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE (the settings API/store reject the combination):
      "task-id" naming pins each task to its own worktree directory, which is incompatible with the cross-task
      recycle pool. The exclusivity is enforced bidirectionally in the UI so a NEW conflict is unreachable —
      this toggle is disabled while naming is "task-id" AND recycling is not already on, and the naming select
      below is disabled while recycling is on. Together they prevent a save that the backend would 400.

      FNXC:TaskPinnedWorktrees 2026-07-16-12:30:
      Legacy-conflict escape hatch: when a stored config already carries BOTH (recycle on + "task-id"), do NOT
      lock both controls — that would strand the operator (unchanged save preserves a state the runtime treats
      as recycling). The runtime backstop makes recycling win in that conflict, so mirror it here: keep this
      toggle ENABLED and CHECKED (its true value, un-coerced) so the operator can turn recycling off, which
      then re-enables the naming select below. The toggle only greys out for the forward-prevention case
      ("task-id" naming while recycling is already off).
