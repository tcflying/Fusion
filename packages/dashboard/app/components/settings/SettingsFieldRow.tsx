/**
 * SettingsFieldRow — the base layout primitive every typed settings row composes
 * (U8 / KTD-10). It owns nothing about the control itself: callers pass the
 * control as `children` and this row handles the surrounding chrome — label,
 * scope badge (global/project), a help affordance (SettingsHelpTip), an error
 * band, and an optional "reset to default" clear affordance.
 *
 * The error band stays inline and is never deferred behind the help tip: a
 * validation message the operator has to go looking for is a message they will
 * not see.
 *
 * Strings are pre-translated by callers (the descriptor carries label/help), so
 * this primitive hardcodes no user-facing copy. The only intrinsic string is the
 * clear button's aria-label, sourced via useTranslation like neighboring
 * components (e.g. WorkflowFieldsPanel).

  Help lives behind a "?" beside the label rather than as a paragraph under the control. Rendering every description inline turned dense sections into walls of prose and is what pushed Merge to invent its own "More details" disclosure; one affordance on the shared row replaces that per-section improvisation.
  The tip sits AFTER the scope badge so the label line reads "Name [scope] ?" — name first, then its qualifiers.
  The copy itself is not hidden: SettingsHelpTip keeps it in the DOM and in the accessibility tree, so search still matches on help text and assistive tech still reaches it.

      Inline rows put the control FIRST in the DOM, not just visually: a checkbox reads "[x] Hide banners", and reordering with CSS alone would leave the tab and screen-reader order saying "Hide banners [x]", which is the wrong sentence.

      FNXC:SettingsStyling 2026-07-16-00:10:
      The label, scope badge, and help tip are wrapped in ONE group so they wrap as prose rather than as flex items.
      Without the wrapper the head is a flex row whose items are [checkbox][label][badge][tip]; once the label is too wide to sit beside the checkbox, the WHOLE label wraps to the next line and strands the checkbox alone on its own — observed on a 390px viewport with "Keep task popups on the view where they were opened".
      With the wrapper, the checkbox is the only sibling flex item and the group takes the remaining width, so the label's TEXT wraps inside it and every continuation line aligns under the first word instead of under the checkbox.
