/*
FNXC:MergerAiReview 2026-07-15-21:50 (FN-8004 follow-up):
The prompt says "End with a single decision line", so a COMPLIANT reviewer puts its reasoning
ABOVE `REVIEW_VERDICT: reject` and ends on the verdict. The parser only scanned lines AFTER the
verdict, so those reasons were dropped and every such rejection degraded to the placeholder
"reviewer rejected the merge without a stated reason" — which was then handed to the corrective
re-merge pass AS its instruction, making the pass a blind re-roll.

Observed on FN-8004's own merge: both attempts ran reject(no reason) → corrective pass → approve,
~7 min per wasted cycle, pushing each attempt past main's ~8-min churn window into a livelock.

Per "Fix the Invariant, Not the Repro": the invariant is that a reviewer's stated reasons reach the
corrective pass REGARDLESS of which side of the verdict line they were written on.
