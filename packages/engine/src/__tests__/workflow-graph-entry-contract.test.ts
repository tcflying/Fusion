THE GRAPH ENTRY CONTRACT. A run with no durable continuation resumes at the card's OWN column instead
of replaying the pipeline from `start`. Before this, every continuation-less run (self-healing graph
re-entry, a fresh dispatch, an operator drag into a processing column) re-entered at the first node of
the FIRST column and dragged the card backward through columns it had already left — aborting its live
session via `abort-on-exit`, and stranding it in any pre-wip column with no releaser. That backward
drag is the reason planning nodes had to live in the implementation column.

These assert the INVARIANT across every lifecycle position a card can hold, not just the plan-in-place
case that motivated it: behind (resume forward), at, and past each column, on the real built-in IRs.

The entry contract under the MERGED planning column — one column carrying `intake` + `hold`,
which is what U11 leaves behind once `triage` is deleted and `todo` becomes "Planning".

REWRITTEN after review. The first cut of this block did two things wrong, and both are the
difference between proving something and appearing to:

1. It asserted against a hand-written synthetic graph. A toy graph proves the RESOLVER's
   arithmetic, not that the operator's board survives — production planning/review topology could
   drift away from the shape under test and nothing here would notice. `mergeTodoIntoPlanning`
   below is instead the literal U11 edit expressed as a transformation, applied to the REAL
   production IR, so these assertions track production topology by construction.

2. It asserted that `resolveColumnResumeNode` returns `undefined` for a card stranded in the
   deleted `triage` column, and that a start node exists. Both can hold while cards strand: the
   thing that actually rescues such a card is the `?? ir.nodes.find(kind === "start")` fallback in
   `run()`, and neither assertion touches it. Deleting that fallback left the old test GREEN. The
   stranded case now drives `executor.run()` and asserts the card really traverses — and going red
   when the fallback is removed is verified, not assumed.

The stranded-card case, driven through `executor.run()` rather than through the resolver.

Rows persisted in `triage` outlive the column U11 deletes. `resolveColumnResumeNode` returns
undefined for a column the IR does not declare, and the ONLY thing that then rescues the card is
`run()`'s `?? ir.nodes.find(kind === "start")` fallback. Asserting "the resolver returns undefined"
and "a start node exists" is compatible with the card stranding, which is why this drives the real
traversal and asserts the card moves.

Verified red: deleting the `?? ir.nodes.find(...)` fallback makes `run()` throw
`WorkflowIrError: Workflow IR missing start node` and this test fails.
