/*
FNXC:Workspace 2026-06-24-15:45 (concurrent workspace tasks — shared browse-root collision regression):
In workspace mode every task runs its agent session rooted at the SHARED browse-only workspace root
(`this.rootDir`); per-sub-repo worktrees are acquired on demand. The session registrations
(executor / step-session / workflow-step) are keyed in the GLOBAL path-keyed activeSessionRegistry,
whose foreign-task guard rejects a second task registering a path already held by a different task.
With the bare root as the key, the SECOND concurrent workspace task failed with
"active-session path <root> is held by task <other>; task <self> may not overwrite it" — so only ONE
task per workspace could ever run (the reported MULT-001 vs MULT-002 failure).

Invariant under test (across ALL session-registration surfaces): two different workspace tasks sharing
the browse-root register concurrently WITHOUT collision, each remains discoverable by liveness
(pathsForTask returns a task-scoped key), and cleanup leaves no leaked entry. Negative control: a
NON-workspace executor (unique worktree path) still rejects a foreign-task overwrite, so the
cross-phase-clobber guard is preserved.
