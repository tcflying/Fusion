/*
FNXC:SessionContention 2026-07-25-21:30 (contention is never a provider failure — regression):
Reported symptom: FN-1403's Plan Review hit "active-session path /home/ubuntu/dev/freemap-svelte is held
by task FN-1398; task FN-1403 may not overwrite it". The engine narrated that as "Plan Review provider
failure — retrying in place (2/2)", spent the provider budget on two immediate retries that could not
possibly clear another task's hold, then left the task parked.

Invariant under test, across every surface a contention error can reach:
 1. the pure classifier recognizes all THREE contention shapes (active-session registry, workspace
    sub-repo acquire lease, workspace sub-repo land lease) and treats them as transient;
 2. the classifier does NOT swallow unrelated failures (negative control);
 3. a contention error is NOT classified as a non-plan-defect PROVIDER failure by the Plan Review
    classifier — that is the exact misrouting that burned the budget;
 4. registration PREVENTS contention where it is preventable: a leaked entry whose holder is dead is
    reclaimed, while a LIVE holder still contends (real serialization must not be clobbered), and a
    too-fresh entry is never reclaimed even if the probe says dead (FN-5256 warming floor).
