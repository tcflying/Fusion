/*
FNXC:PlanReviewWorktree 2026-07-25-20:40 (concurrent root-rooted step sessions — single-repo regression):
Read-only graph nodes that need no worktree run rooted at the executor's `rootDir`, and a todo task has
no worktree of its own. Plan Review is the canonical one. With the bare root as the activeSessionRegistry
key, the SECOND task to reach such a node failed with "active-session path <root> is held by task <other>;
task <self> may not overwrite it" — narrated as a Plan Review provider failure, retried in place against a
hold retrying can never clear, then parked once the budget was spent (reported: FN-1398 holding
/home/ubuntu/dev/freemap-svelte while FN-1403 planned).

Invariant under test: on a plain single-repo project (NO workspaceConfig — the workspace fix did not cover
this), two different tasks register root-rooted sessions concurrently across ALL THREE registration
surfaces (executor / step-session / workflow-step) without collision, each stays discoverable by liveness,
and each delete surface cleans up its synthetic key. Negative control: a genuine shared per-task worktree
path (not the root) still rejects the foreign-task overwrite.
