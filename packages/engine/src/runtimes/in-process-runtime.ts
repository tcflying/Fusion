 * How long a park-skipped continuation leaves the due window for.

 * The due poll is a FIFO batch (`limit: 20`) and a skipped item stays `runnable`
 * and due, so it re-fills a batch slot on every pass. Before the approval guard
 * an approval-held item was DISPATCHED, so it never accumulated; now that it is
 * correctly skipped, 20 cards parked on approval would starve every newer
 * plan-review continuation until enough humans decided. That is a real
 * consequence of the guard, not a pre-existing one.
 *
 * Deferral, not a state change: the item stays `runnable`, so every "is the graph
 * idle?" predicate that reasons over ACTIVE_WORKFLOW_WORK_ITEM_STATES behaves
 * exactly as before — moving it to `held` would remove it from the due set too,
 * but nothing requeues a `held` planning item, which trades starvation for a
 * permanent strand. `retryAfter` is a pure due-window filter, so the worst case
 * is bounded latency instead.
 *
 * 60s is chosen against HUMAN latency: the park it defers is waiting on a person,
 * who has already taken minutes or hours, so an extra minute after the decision
 * is invisible — while occupancy of the shared batch drops from every poll (~2s)
 * to at most one slot per minute per parked card.

 * Plan Review run for a card that was actually handed off.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG: this fired on every finished specification, because the seam that
 * announces it fired unconditionally. So a card parked at the manual plan-approval
 * gate — finalize writes `status: "awaiting-approval"` and RETURNS EARLY, before the
 * release move — was logged as "Specified X → todo" and had a Plan Review run armed
 * for a plan the operator had not approved. PR #2491 stopped the seeder from acting
 * on that, defensively, at the seeder. This removes the reason it was ever asked.
 *
 * `released` is the ONLY outcome that licenses arming a run: it is the only one that
 * means the card crossed into the hold column (or was already resting there) and is
 * the graph's now. `parked` belongs to a human, `withheld` belongs to the caller's
 * retry budget — arming a run for either is doing work nobody asked for.
 *
 * The log line reports the real outcome rather than asserting a move that may not
 * have happened; an operator reading "Specified → todo" for a card sitting in the
 * planner column is being told something false about their own board.
 *
 * EXTRACTED from the inline `onSpecifyComplete` callback for the same reason the
 * continuation drain was in PR #2491: the callback is constructed inside
 * `InProcessRuntime`, whose construction attaches to the real project registry, so
 * no test could tell "the reaction respects the outcome" from "the reaction ignores
