FNXC:Workspace 2026-06-21-20:10:
"workspace-repo-acquire" is a DISTINCT registry kind reserved for the
acquisition-time same-sub-repo exclusivity entry (U2/KTD4). It is keyed by the
sub-repo absolute path (NOT the worktree path) so two concurrent workspace tasks
contending for the SAME sub-repo are serialized. Keeping it distinct from
"executor"/"step-session" means it does not collide with the executor's later
session registration on the produced worktree path.

FNXC:Workspace 2026-06-22-02:10 (Phase C U3, KTD4):
"workspace-repo-land" is a DISTINCT registry kind for the LAND-time (merge phase)
same-sub-repo lease. Like the acquire kind it is keyed by the sub-repo ABSOLUTE
path, but it guards a different lifecycle scope: two workspace tasks landing the
SAME sub-repo onto its local integration ref are serialized so their clean-room
ai-merge worktrees do not collide. This lease is for SERIALIZATION / clean-room-
collision avoidance only — it is NOT what makes the interleaved `update-ref`
correct. `advanceIntegrationBranchRef`'s CAS already makes a concurrent advance
safe by construction (concurrent-advance → rebuild). The acquire lease (execution
phase) and the land lease (merge phase) never overlap in time on the same path, so
keeping them distinct kinds (each released in its own `finally`) means a stale
entry of one kind can never be mistaken for a live hold of the other.

  its own entry). Callers that may contend (the land lease) must lookupByPath-then-throw a

FNXC:SessionContention 2026-07-25-21:30 (contention prevention — foreign-stale reclaim):
Registration contention has exactly three shapes, and only one of them is legitimate:
  1. Two tasks on the SHARED repo root. Not real contention — read-only root-rooted sessions need no
     path exclusivity. Eliminated by construction: `sessionRegistryPath` task-scopes the root key.
  2. A LEAKED entry whose owning task is dead (crashed run, torn-down executor, engine restart that
     lost the session but not the map). Waiting for that holder is waiting forever — the holder will
     never release. Reclaim it, which is what this seam does.
  3. A LIVE holder on the same path. This is genuine serialization (the workspace sub-repo leases are
     built on it) and the caller must wait, never overwrite.
So: probe the holder for liveness, reclaim when it is provably dead AND the entry has aged past the
FN-5256 staleness floor (a just-registered entry belongs to a warming session whose maps are not
populated yet — treating it as dead would yank a live shell), and surface a typed contention error only
for case 3. `holderLiveProbe` returning true is always respected; an unknown/throwing probe must be
reported as LIVE by its caller so ambiguity refuses the reclaim.
