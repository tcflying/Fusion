/**
 * Merge trait behavior (U7, R10) — `@fusion/engine` side.
 *
 * The merge trait turns merge/PR orchestration, merge strategy, squash posture
 * and file-scope enforcement mode into *configuration* over the substrate merge
 * capability (KTD-6). This module owns `resolveMergePolicy` — a small
 * read-through resolver consulted by `merger.ts` at its existing policy-knob
 * read sites. It reads merge-trait config from the task's resolved workflow;
 * when the workflow's merge trait carries no config, e.g. the built-in default
 * workflow, it falls back to the existing settings knobs
 * (`directMergeCommitStrategy`, `mergeStrategy`, scope settings).
 *
 * The three 2026-05-23 lost-work guards stay in `merger.ts` mechanics and are
 * UNREACHABLE from this config (KTD-6 / R10): sibling `fusion/fn-*` merge-target
 * rejection, line-anchored commit attribution, and the no-op-finalize
 * `modifiedFiles` preservation are not gated by any field this resolver
 * exposes.

// ── Merge trait hooks: owned by core, NOT this module ────────────────────────
//
// The engine deliberately does NOT register `merge` onEnter/onExit impls.
//
// `merge.onEnter` is invoked by core's `applyDefaultWorkflowMoveEffects` as
// `impl(ctx)` with a single `DefaultWorkflowMoveContext` — an in-lock,
// pre-commit, in-memory field-mutation phase that carries NO store handle. Core
// registers the correct ctx-shaped impl (`applyInReviewEnterEffects`) via
// `registerDefaultWorkflowHooks()`; it clears the in-review scheduler state
// (`status: queued`, `blockedBy`, `overlapBlockedBy`) and mirrors the flag-OFF
// inline block in `store.ts`.
//
// An earlier version of this module registered a `mergeOnEnter(store, task)`
// impl here that enqueued onto the merge queue. That was wrong on three counts:
//   1. Signature mismatch — the only caller passes `ctx`, so `store`/`task` bound
//      to `(ctx, undefined)` and dereferencing `task.id` threw at runtime
//      (TypeError: cannot read 'id' of undefined) during the hold-release sweep.
//   2. Slot collision — it clobbered core's field-effects adapter on the
//      last-write-wins registry, dropping the in-review state clears.
//   3. Redundant responsibility — the queue enqueue is in-txn and store-owned on
//      the handoff path (`store.ts` enqueues on `fromHandoff`, shared by both
//      flag states), and direct non-handoff entry into `in-review` is audited as
//      a handoff-invariant violation. There is no sanctioned entry into the
//      merge column that needs a hook-driven enqueue.
//
// `merge.onExit` similarly needs no impl: the store dequeues in-lock via the
// private `dequeueMergeQueueOnColumnExit` on every move (lease-aware), and the
// ctx move-effects path never invokes `merge.onExit` at all.

/*
FNXC:MergeTrait 2026-06-18-13:05:
The engine must not register `merge.onEnter` or `merge.onExit` hooks because core owns the ctx-shaped `merge.onEnter` field-effects adapter. Keeping hook registration out of this module prevents last-write-wins registry collisions and preserves in-review scheduler-state clears under workflow columns.
