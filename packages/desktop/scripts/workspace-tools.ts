FNXC:DesktopPackaging 2026-07-01-21:15:
Durable fix for the packaged desktop app missing runtime dependencies.
electron-builder's pnpm support runs `pnpm list --prod` and silently drops
`deduped` subtrees, so the embedded Local runtime's `import("@fusion/engine")`
closure (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, the pi-ai provider SDKs, etc.) was never
packed and the app crashed with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND. Instead of relying on that
collector, materialize the complete production closure with `pnpm deploy`
(legacy + hoisted => a real flat node_modules that pnpm resolves correctly) and
point electron-builder at that staged directory via --projectDir.

- --prod drops devDependencies (electron itself), so copy electron's package.json
  into the stage so electron-builder can still compute the version (it downloads
  the runtime separately).
- Rewrite the staged electron-builder.yml output to ../dist-electron so artifacts
  still land in packages/desktop/dist-electron for the existing workflow globs.
- The stage has no pnpm-lock, so electron-builder treats it as a plain flat
  project and packs the whole node_modules — no dedup gap.
