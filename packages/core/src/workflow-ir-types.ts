FNXC:WorkflowOptionalGroup 2026-06-21-11:00:
An `optional-group` node is a container (mirroring `foreach`/`loop`) whose `template` subgraph the executor runs ONCE when the group is enabled for the task and passes through (skips) when disabled.
Enable state reuses the per-task `enabledWorkflowSteps` facet keyed by the group node id, seeded from `defaultOn` at task creation — this replaces the execution-inert declaration-based optional-steps model (`WorkflowOptionalStep`/`optionalSteps`).
Single pass only: no iteration, no rework budget. Rework edges are forbidden inside the template so the single-pass guarantee is unambiguous (validated in `validateOptionalGroup`).

FNXC:WorkflowOptionalStepRevisionBudget 2026-06-27-12:15:
Optional-group remediation still runs the template once per graph pass, but workflow authors can set a per-step `maxRevisions` override for the PRE-merge fix→re-review cycle. A non-negative integer caps that optional step against its own review-attempt partition, `"unbounded"` removes the ceiling, and absence preserves the effective global `maxPostReviewFixes` behavior for generic optional gates.
