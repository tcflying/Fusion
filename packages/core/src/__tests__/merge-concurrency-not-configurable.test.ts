FNXC:CapacityModel 2026-07-28-10:15:
MERGE CONCURRENCY MUST NEVER BECOME A SETTING.

The capacity model is two CONFIGURABLE numbers per project (total agents,
maxWorktrees) plus one FIXED invariant: exactly one merge in flight per project.
The enforcement lives in the engine's merge pump and is ratcheted by
`packages/engine/src/__tests__/merge-single-flight-invariant.test.ts`.

THIS file guards the other direction — that no one makes the fixed number
configurable. A merge-concurrency knob would not fail the pump ratchet: it would
sit unread for a release (like `maxTriageConcurrent`, which shipped in the schema,
the Settings UI and i18n while being read by ZERO enforcement sites) and then get
wired up by someone who assumed a setting that exists must mean something. Merge
is where the irreversible work happens; every merge-safety guard assumes one.
