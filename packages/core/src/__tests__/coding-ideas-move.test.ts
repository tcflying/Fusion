FNXC:WorkflowColumns 2026-07-05-19:10:
Regression for the disappearing move on custom workflow columns. Workflow columns graduated to
always-on (no experimental flag emitted), but moveTaskInternal still gated its workflow path on the
retired strict compatibility flag, so it fell back to the legacy VALID_TRANSITIONS table — which is
keyed only by the legacy column ids. A task in a non-legacy column (Coding (Ideas) → "ideas") could
not move: "Invalid transition: 'ideas' → 'todo'. Valid targets: none".

Surface enumeration (invariant: a move is validated by the task's WORKFLOW adjacency, not the legacy
table, on a default project with NO experimental flag set):
 - Custom intake column forward move: ideas → todo is allowed.
 - Full custom-column chain onward: todo → in-progress → in-review all succeed (→ done is gated by the
   workflow's own merge trait, which is orthogonal to transition adjacency and excluded here).
 - Non-adjacent move still rejects with the workflow's targets (ideas → in-progress).
 - Holds for both user- and engine-sourced moves.
 - Default workflow (legacy column ids) is unchanged (parity), verified in move-task-characterization.
