FNXC:WorkflowWorkItemCas 2026-07-27-22:10 (U7, PR #2491 review — greptile P1):

`WorkflowWorkItemTransitionPatch.expectedState` is a compare-and-set guard: the
transition applies only if the row's state read INSIDE the transaction still
equals it, and is otherwise a no-op returning the row untouched.

WHY IT EXISTS: a caller that decided from a due-poll SNAPSHOT and then writes
unconditionally can clobber a newer state another node reached in between. The
concrete case is the planning drain's fairness deferral — it pushes an
operator-parked item's `retryAfter` forward so the item stops re-filling the FIFO
due batch. Written blind, that would reset a `running` claim back to `runnable`
and let the item be claimed twice. The pre-existing terminal-state check already
refuses cancelled/succeeded/failed (it throws), so `running` was the one
unguarded state, and it is the one a live worker holds.

Losing the CAS is an ordinary outcome for a snapshot-driven caller, not an error —
hence a silent no-op rather than a throw. A throw would push every caller into a
try/catch whose only correct body is "do nothing".

These run against real PostgreSQL through the shared harness, so the guard is
proven where it actually lives: inside the transaction that re-reads the row.
