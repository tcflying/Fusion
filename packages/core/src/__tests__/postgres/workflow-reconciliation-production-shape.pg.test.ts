/*
FNXC:WorkflowColumns 2026-07-28-00:00 (U12 — R9, R12):
The three U5 (R20) workflow-lifecycle reconciliation guards, exercised in the
PRODUCTION SHAPE — that is, with `experimentalFeatures.workflowColumns` NEVER
written by the test.

WHY THAT MATTERS, and why this file is separate from
`workflow-authoritative-reads.pg.test.ts`. Every one of these guards used to be
gated on `store.workflowColumnsFlagOn()`, which reads the RAW
`experimentalFeatures.workflowColumns` key. No production writer sets that key, so
all three were inert for every real project:

  - removing an OCCUPIED column from a workflow silently succeeded, stranding the
    cards in a column their workflow no longer declared;
  - deleting a workflow captured an EMPTY occupant list, so its cards were left in
    that workflow's columns until the next engine startup sweep;
  - switching a task's workflow never reconciled its column, and the
    `reconciliation` field the API promises was never populated.

The pre-existing coverage reached these guards by writing the flag ON itself, which
is precisely why the gap was invisible: the tests passed against a configuration no
operator has. Every case below therefore asserts through the PUBLIC store seams with
the flag ABSENT.

REVERT CHECK — each case fails if its flip is undone:
  - restore `flagOn &&` on the edit guard  -> "blocks a workflow edit ..." fails,
    because the update resolves instead of rejecting with OccupiedColumnsError, and
    "re-homes occupants ..." fails because the cards never move.
  - restore `flagOn ?  : []` on the delete capture -> "re-homes a deleted workflow's
    occupants ..." fails, because the card stays in `custom-hold`.
  - restore the `workflowColumnsFlagOn()` early return on switch -> both switch cases
    fail, because `reconciliation` comes back undefined and the card does not move.
I ran each of those three reverts individually against this file and confirmed the
matching failures. Note for anyone repeating it: `workflow-ops.ts` contains TWO
identical `const occupantTaskIds = await store.listWorkflowOccupantTaskIds(id, false)`
lines — one in the field-reconcile block, one in the delete path — so a first-match
edit reverts the wrong one and the delete case then passes against what looks like
reverted code. Anchor on surrounding context. Measured output is in the PR description.
