/*
FNXC:MovePathConvergence 2026-07-27-18:30 (Phase A2 — workflow-owned lifecycle):
DIFFERENTIAL CHARACTERIZATION of the two move-side-effect implementations in
`moveTaskInternalImpl`, run through ONE shared fixture.

WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. `moves.ts` branches on `useWorkflow` =
`isWorkflowColumnsCompatibilityFlagEnabled(settings)`, which reads the RAW
`experimentalFeatures.workflowColumns` key. Nothing in production writes that
key, so:

  - the INLINE branch is the LIVE path for essentially every project;
  - `default-workflow-hooks.ts` (the trait-hook path) is DEAD.

`moves.ts` says so itself at the flag-OFF adjacency branch. Only one
implementation runs in production, so equivalence CANNOT be observed by running
the suite normally — the dead path is never entered. Each case here therefore
FORCES both paths explicitly through the same fixture:

    flag ABSENT              → the production shape (inline branch)
    workflowColumns: true    → the hooks path

and asserts on observable state, not on which functions were called. Equivalence
asserted by reading code is not equivalence.

SCOPE NOTE. The `useWorkflow` flag gates far more than the side-effect block:
validation, in-transaction capacity, the transitionPending marker, and plugin
column gates are all inside it. Those divergences are characterized in the
companion describe at the bottom, which is what makes the convergence decision an
operator call rather than a refactor.

    WAS `UNPROVEN: … did NOT reject on EITHER path`. That test recorded an honest
    negative result and left the cause open: "something further in
    (`resolveColumnCapacity`'s limit resolution, or what
    `countActiveInCapacitySlotAsync` counts as an occupant) keeps the check from
    firing even when the flag is on. This suite does not establish which." It
    also predicted its own obsolescence: "if a future change makes this reject,
    that is the capacity gate coming alive."

    THE ANSWER, established by the sentinel fix: neither of those guesses. The
    counter and the limit resolution were both fine. `moves.ts` asked the counter
    for occupants of pool `"builtin:coding"` while the counter buckets
    selection-less rows under `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_POOL_ID`, so the count came back
    0 for a pool nothing is ever placed in. Both sides now derive the pool
    through `resolveCapacityPoolId`, and the hooks path rejects.

    The blast-radius question this test was holding open is therefore ANSWERED for
    the hooks path and STILL OPEN for the inline one: the inline path remains
    structurally unable to run the block (`if (useWorkflow && …)`), so converging
    the paths still turns store-level capacity rejection on for every project.
    That convergence stays an operator decision — see the R2 note in
