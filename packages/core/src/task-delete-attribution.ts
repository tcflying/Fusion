FNXC:TaskDeleteAttribution 2026-07-26-14:30:
Four tasks were deleted inside one hour in a live project and the run-audit rows could not answer
"which one did the human delete?". Two concrete holes produced that: (1) `task:deleted` metadata
persisted `auditContext.sessionId` but never `auditContext.taskId`, so an AI agent's `fn_task_delete`
call recorded only the tool surface (`agentId:"pi-extension"`) and the CALLING task/agent was lost
forever; (2) the dashboard `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` handler hardcoded `agentId:"system"`, so an
operator clicking Delete in the UI and a script hitting the same endpoint produced byte-identical
rows. This module is the single closed vocabulary that fixes both: `callerKind` names the class of
actor and `callerTaskId` names the calling task.

TRUST MODEL — read before extending. `callerKind` is ATTRIBUTION, NOT AUTHENTICATION. The HTTP
variants are derived from a self-reported `x-fusion-client` request header, so all the row can
honestly claim is "the client identified itself as the dashboard UI" (`operator-ui`) versus
"nothing identified itself" (`api-unattributed`). Anything can send the header. Never gate a
permission, a delete, or any other decision on this value, and never describe it as proof of a
human. It exists so forensics has a starting hypothesis, not a verdict.

Scope note: this is observability only. No delete-blocking, gating, or permission logic is added or
implied here; whether agents should hold `fn_task_delete` at all is a separate operator policy call.

/**
 * FNXC:TaskDeleteAttribution 2026-07-26-14:30:
 * Closed set of delete-caller classes, ordered from most to least attributable.
 *
 * - `operator-ui` — an HTTP client that identified itself as the dashboard UI (see trust model).
 * - `operator-cli` — the interactive `fn task delete` command, which prompts a human for
 *   confirmation at a terminal. Added beyond the original four because that surface is a real,
 *   distinct human actor already tagged `agentId:"cli"`; without its own member it would have to
 *   masquerade as `api-unattributed` and re-blur exactly the operator-vs-automation line this
 *   change exists to draw.
 * - `agent-tool` — an AI agent's tool call (`fn_task_delete`). Pair with `callerTaskId`.
 * - `engine` — an autonomous engine lane (triage split-close, duplicate resolution, self-healing).
 * - `api-unattributed` — an HTTP caller that sent no recognized client header. The deliberate
 *   default: unknown is recorded as unknown rather than guessed as operator.

 * `taskId` is the CALLER's task (the task whose agent is asking for the delete), not the target.
