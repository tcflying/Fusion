FNXC:LegacyAdoption 2026-07-21-17:30:
Store-open adoption (adoptLegacyTaskRowsOnOpen) runs on the project-bound
fusion_runtime connection. public.fusion_schema_migrations only received
superuser grants, so the drained-marker SELECT/INSERT failed with permission
denied on every clean open (TUI spam: "Legacy-adoption drained-marker write
failed" with a bare Drizzle "Failed query" message).

Grant SELECT for the short-circuit read. Do NOT grant unrestricted INSERT —
runtime must not be able to stamp arbitrary numeric migration versions. Instead
expose a SECURITY DEFINER helper that can only write the exact non-numeric
LEGACY_ADOPTION_DRAINED_MARKER row.
