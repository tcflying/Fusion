/**
 * Barrel export for the PostgreSQL schema layer.
 *
 * FNXC:PostgresSchema 2026-06-24-03:20:
 * Aggregates the three application schemas (project/central/archive) and the
 * plugin-owned tables. This is the single import surface for the data-layer
 * features (U4+) that need Drizzle table references for type-safe queries.
 *
 * The fresh migration baseline (postgres/migrations/0000_initial.sql) is the
 * materialized snapshot of these definitions; applying it to an empty database
 * yields the schema these Drizzle objects describe (VAL-SCHEMA-001).
